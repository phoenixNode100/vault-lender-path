## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** 18+ (recommended: use nvm for version management)
- **Web3 Wallet** (MetaMask, Rainbow, or compatible)
- **Sepolia ETH** for gas fees (get from [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/))

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/phoenixNode100/vault-lender-path.git
cd vault-lender-path

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# 4. Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Configuration

```env
# Network Configuration
VITE_CHAIN_ID=11155111
VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY

# Wallet Connect
VITE_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Optional: Alternative RPC
VITE_ALT_RPC_URL=https://1rpc.io/sepolia
```

## üìã Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Contract: `VaultLender.sol`

Our FHE-enabled smart contract provides a comprehensive lending ecosystem:

#### üîê **Encrypted Data Structures**
```solidity
struct LoanApplication {
    euint32 requestedAmount;      // Encrypted loan amount
    euint32 collateralValue;     // Encrypted collateral value
    euint32 creditScore;         // Encrypted credit score
    euint32 loanTerm;           // Encrypted loan duration
    // ... additional encrypted fields
}
```

#### üéØ **Key Functions**

| Function | Purpose | FHE Protection |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `submitLoanApplication()` | Submit encrypted loan requests | ‚úÖ All financial data encrypted |
| `approveLoan()` | Approve loans with encrypted rates | ‚úÖ Interest rates remain private |
| `createVault()` | Create lending vaults | ‚úÖ Liquidity amounts encrypted |
| `makeRepayment()` | Process loan repayments | ‚úÖ Payment amounts private |
| `updateCreditScore()` | Update borrower scores | ‚úÖ Credit data encrypted |

## üîí Security & Privacy Features

### **FHE Implementation**
- **Homomorphic Operations**: Perform calculations on encrypted data without decryption
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify transactions without revealing underlying data
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Data remains encrypted from submission to completion

### **Smart Contract Security**
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions for different user types
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all encrypted inputs
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient contract design to minimize transaction costs

## üåê Deployment Options
